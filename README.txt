How to set up:
To play on the same network, users must:
1. Ensure that users are on the same connected WiFi network.

2. Select one computer to host the network.

3. Go to 'settings.py'

3. Change SERVER variable of all users to the network ip address (e.g. school network) of the host computer with "" surrounding it.

4. Run 'server.py' using the host computer selected in Step 2 (ONLY 1 COMPUTER PER NETWORK). Terminal will print "Server started! Connected blackjack now available!"

5. Run 'client.py' to play! Users should be able to play against each other now. This may require using the 'Run and Debug' VSCode function to run both the server and a client.


If correct specification IP to server has not been run, users will experience:
- When attempting to connect via 'Start game' on Main Menu, computer will forcibly close the connection.
- This means that the program will black screen for a few seconds before returning user to the Main Menu. Hence, please wait a few seconds.
- User will need to then follow the instructions above to resolve the issue.

- If errors persist with connection, attempt to host server using a different computer.
